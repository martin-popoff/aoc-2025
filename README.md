# Advent of Code 2025 - Rust Edition
Hello! These are my attempts at the [advent of code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/) using Rust.

## Rules
1. Rust only
2. std only (hopefully)
3. No LLMs/Copilot/AI
4. Fun and joy

## Observations
I know my code is absolutely not the most idiomatic/correct way to write Rust code. I've provided a second function to each day with the best-looking code I could come up after my original solution, following some consulting with Opus - mainly to reflect the difference between my current understanding and use of Rust and a more optimum way of doing things.
